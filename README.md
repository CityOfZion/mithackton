## Overview

City of Zion (CoZ) is a community of developers building the NEO ecosystem tooling, we look weekly at every PR that close issues sent to projects in CoZ and vote to reward those in NEO, a positive loop for developers - with time their work impacts NEO and the rewards get valuable in many ways.
